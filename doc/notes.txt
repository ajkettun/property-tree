TODO
====

- Goal? Learn Kotlin or really get it done? Kotlin might not work too well from JS.

- Property name, are name spaces needed? How to support enums, bit cleaner to use?
- Reserved names like empty?

- Test API from Javascript and Java, is it clumsy?

- JSON / Javascript
- Inheritance, inclusion, constants and filtering
    -Separate modules with extension functions

- Property forest, property definitions

- Write README with examples
- Unit tests and coverage
- Publish to Github

- Custom text file format, json is verbose

- XML?
